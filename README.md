# Connect-Four-Game
GA: SEI-Unit 1: Project 1 - (Game: Connect Four)

A Harry Potter themeed Connect Four Game, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The link of the game (github link for now): https://github.com/fjalafoo/Connect-Four-Game

How to play:

Player 1 taps anywhere with an aim to get four in a row (whether vertically, horizentally, or diagonally)
Player 2 does the same thing
so both players aim for a straight 4s, and they have to make sure they ruin the other player fours in order to win!
in order to win this game, there were many winning options, calculated as: Vertical Wins: 37=21 Diagonal Wins: 38=24 Horizental Wins: 4*6=24 Total Win Options: 21+24+24=69
Most of my code was manually, so each function was built using if statements or manually assigning values to variables.

In my project I began with wireframes and pseudo code, here are some pictures of my wireframes ((using Figma)):

The game is still working progress, and I am willing to make it more DRY code using for-loops and other functions.

I am very proud of how the game turned out to be in such a short time, but I will work on it more!!
