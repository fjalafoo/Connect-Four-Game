# Connect-Four-Game
GA: SEI-Unit 1: Project 1 - (Game: Connect Four)

A Harry Potter themeed Connect Four Game, 
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The link of the game (github link for now): https://github.com/fjalafoo/Connect-Four-Game 

How to play:
- Player 1 taps anywhere with an aim to get four in a row (whether vertically, horizentally, or diagonally)
- Player 2 does the same thing
- so both players aim for a straight 4s, and they have to make sure they ruin the other player fours in order to win!
- in order to win this game, there were many winning options, calculated as:
  Vertical Wins: 3*7=21
  Diagonal Wins: 3*8=24
  Horizental Wins: 4*6=24
Total Win Options: 21+24+24=69

Most of my code was manually, so each function was built using if statements or manually assigning values to variables.

In my project I began with wireframes and pseudo code, here are some pictures of my wireframes ((using Figma)):
